                <h3>How It Works?</h3>
                <p>The platform operates on a simple, transparent "Post-and-Connect" model. A user submits a task through a straightforward form, which instantly populates the public task board. Interested helpers can then view the job details and use the provided contact information to reach out directly. Built with a lightweight PHP and MySQL backend, the site ensures that data is stored securely and displayed dynamically without unnecessary complexity.</p>

                <h3>Why it Exist?</h3>
                <p>In an era of expensive, corporate service apps, CampusTask was created to bring the focus back to community-level help. It exists to remove the barriers between neighbors, providing a free and accessible space where people can save time and others can earn extra income. By digitizing the traditional "paper flyer" board, it makes finding local help faster, more organized, and available to everyone.</p>
